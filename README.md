### What is the Burmese New Year's Day?
 
After the last day of New Year Festival, New Year's Day is ("·Äî·Äæ·ÄÖ·Ä∫·ÄÜ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äê·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äõ·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äî·Ä±·Ä∑, Hnit hsan ta yet nei" in Myanmar language) **17th April** for the Burmese people.<br> 
The Burmese calendar is the traditional Lunisolar Calendar indicates both the Moon phase and the time of the solar year. <br>



Therefore, the Burmese people believe the new day begins at dawn (considering 5:00 AM [here](https://github.com/Swift-sol/Burmese-New-Year-s-Day-Countdown) instead of at midnight. <br>On this day, Burmese people may make New Year‚Äôs resolutions usually about changing bad behaviour, avoiding sins and
   promising to do more good deeds for karma.<br><br>
   
  ***Some example of meritorious deeds performed on this day are :***<br><br>
        -__donating tasty food__<br>
        -__storing up merit__<br>
        -__rescuing fish from ponds,lakes and rivers that are drying up and releasing them into proper places__<br>
        -__buying animals (Bird, Fish & Cow ) from market and then releasing and setting them free__<br>
        -__visiting elder relatives to perform a ritual hair-washing,pay obeisance by gadaw (also called shihko)<br>
            with presents and food which can help boost the body's immune system__<br>
        -__celebrating novitiation ceremonies ["Shinbyu" in Myanmar language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinbyu) for [Buddhists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_in_Myanmar)__ <br><br>
    
> In the tradition of Theravada Buddhism, "Novitiation" is the obligation of all Burmese parents to make sure their sons are admitted to the Buddhist "Sangha" once they have reached the age of seven or older.
> Also, it is the parents' proudest accomplishment and the best gift to their sons. It is believed that this deed is the highest and the greatest donation as the parent. This donation can be accomplished by supporting not only their sons but also other boys to become **novices** or **monks**.
>
>If the boy is under 20 years old, he will be a novice who has to keep **["the Ten Precepts"](https://www.nku.edu/~kenneyr/Buddhism/ptf/dasasila.html) and obeys the 75 Sekhiyas** (the rules concerning with behavior, discipline, self-restraint and dignity).
> If the boy is over 20, he can only be the Old Novice (known as ‚ÄúKoyin Gyi‚Äù in Myanmar language). ‚ÄúKoyin Gyi‚Äù need to keep **["the Ten Precepts"](https://www.nku.edu/~kenneyr/Buddhism/ptf/dasasila.html) and ["the 227 rules of pƒÅtimokkha"](https://en.dhammadana.org/sangha/vinaya/227.htm).** Novices spend a short time in a monastery to learn the essence of Buddha's teachings,the Dhamma.

### What is the Burmese New Year Festival?

the Burmese New Year Festival is also known as 'Thingyan in Myanmar language'.
 In Burmese language, ‚ÄòThingyan‚Äô means ‚Äúchange‚Äù (changing from one to another, the old year to the New Year).
 According to the ancient tradition, all bad luck and the sins of the previous year only could be washed away <br>
 by Thinyan water (that thrown on others with the water in the Thingyan festival) in preparation for the goodness for the New Year.
  
 Before fixing to Western calendar 13 to 16 April, the dates of the Thingyan festival are calculated according to the traditional Burmese lunisolar calendar. Thingyan water festival is one of significance religious and spiritual festivals for the Burmese. 
> The water festival is also celebrated in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia.

 
  
### How do we celebrate?

'Thingyan' or the Burmese New Year Festival also known as the Water Festival because splashing water at each other is the most distinguishing feature of this festival. 
The traditional way of celebrating Thingyan was the sprinkling of scented water from a silver bowl with Eugenia leaves.
