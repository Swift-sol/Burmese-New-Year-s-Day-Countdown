#### This project is about Myanmar New Year's Day & New Year Festival

<br>

## The unusual thing about this project is: the new year day will count at 5:00 AM.
-  `The Burmese calendar is the traditional Lunisolar Calendar indicates both the Moon phase and the time of the solar year.`

-  `Therefore, the Burmese people believe the new day begins at dawn (considering 5:00 AM here instead of at midnight.)`
